# Memory vs Responsiveness Trade-offs

## Problem
Optimizing for speed often increases memory usage, while minimizing memory can slow down execution.

## Observations
- Cached data improves speed but increases memory footprint
- Aggressive memory cleanup may impact responsiveness

## Trade-offs
- Memory-heavy caching improves performance
- Lean memory usage improves stability on low-end devices

## Conclusion
Balanced systems prioritize responsiveness while maintaining reasonable memory constraints.
